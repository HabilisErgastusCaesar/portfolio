O'Neill asks that Teal'c be allowed to join his team but Gen. Hammond thinks that will be unlikely given that he is the host for a Goa'uld. Unknown to anyone, however, is that O'Neill's close friend, Maj. Charles Kawalsky, leader of SG-2, has been infected by a Goa'uld, an immature version that has not yet taken complete control of the host. Kawalsky is having regular blackouts during which the Goa'uld is trying to return to the gate. An MRI reveals what is wrong but it's unlikely the creature that has fused itself to Kawalsky's spine can be surgically removed. Meanwhile, Col. Kennedy arrives to question Teal'c who has pledged his loyalty to his new world.",

Only one Tollan, Narim, shows an active interest in life on earth, especially in captain Samantha Carter and the cat Schrodinger she gives him, explaining his planet was destroyed after the Tollan supplied an unlimited energy source to a primitive neighboring planet which abused it for a cataclysmic weapon. Meanwhile, the White House authorized NID colonel Maybourne to take charge over the Tollan for military purposes, exactly Omoc's nightmare.",

More importantly, Earth is under attack from the Goa'uld who have already killed over 1 billion people. Carter believes that somehow, Jackson is from a parallel dimension. When Jackson learns the point of origin of the Goa'uld attack, he wants to return to his own universe, believing that his Earth will be similarly attacked.",

They arrive on a planet which is deserted on the surface, but are awaited by well-camouflaged, armed Tok'ra who bring them to tunnels which they create by means of a mysterious crystal, which can also undo them afterward. Both parties are quite suspicious, the team feels like captives, and indeed, the Tok'ra leader Yosuuf fears they cannot be released, at least until the whole site is moved. Meanwhile, the Tau'ri barely overcome their suspicion against the Tok'ra Goa'uld biology (with symbiote), when asked to volunteer themselves as 'hosts', and Carter learns Martouf (and his symbiote, Lantash) was Jolinar's lover, hence has a special connection with her.",

When SG-3 arrives and informs Sam about her terminally ill father General Jacob Carter's quickly worsening condition, she realizes the symbiote's healing powers, confirmed to apply to cancer, make hosting an offer to good to refuse for him. Garshaw allows Sam and Jack to return and convince both generals to allow the plan, which is achieved. Meanwhile, the Tok'ra must hastily evacuate, destroying tunnels behind them, because a large-scale attack by Apophis's troops is expected soon, while Jacob meets his potential symbiotic partner Selmak and his equally terminal predecessor to help him decide. Jack verifies his strong suspicion there is traitor among the Tok'ra who is communicating with the Goa'uld.",

The council of elders refuses to allow resuming of the mining, which is disrespectful to nature, but Tonané is delegated to be shown alternatives on earth. Both teams return to SGC, or so it appears; in fact, SG-11 is a series of incarnated spirits, who are soon convinced the earthlings are most untrustworthy.",

Apophis demands sanctuary, provided Dr. Fraiser can save his life, at least on account of the human host, but without a sarcophagus the prognosis for his symbiont is lousy; he offers all his Goa'uld knowledge in exchange for a new host, i.e. his life, revealing he was defeated by the terrible Sokar, once supreme system lord till an alliance lead by Ra and Apophis unseated him. The confrontation with Daniel, on account of Amaunet/Sha're and their son Klorel, and with former prime Teal'c, is bitter for all three. The Tok'ra send Martouf to warn the Tau'ri must hand over Apophis, but their warning is ignored- until Sokar proves he can bombard the iris with accelerated particles and ultimately cut through it, so the White House orders his extradition, but before they can he dies, unlike his host, an Ancient Egyptian temple scribe of Amun.",

When Simon implores SG-1 to spare his beloved Mary and take him instead, they even nurse her chicken pox. Simon hopes they are sent by God to deliver them from the satanic burden, but the canon who rules the village as 'spiritual' leader is faithful to Sokar and fears his authority, which rests on his right to select the 'damned soul' to be sacrificed, has been challenged, so he declares Teal'c a demon and incarcerates all SG-1. Witch-trial-type ordeals see the Jaffa 'proven' a demon and executed by drowning, and Daniel refuses the canon's warning to leave immediately. When Teal'c's symbiote allows a resurrection even Sam hadn't expected, they are all designated possessed and sacrificed, along with Mary. Simon follows the Unas with a staff weapon to liberate them, but he's not alone.",

Daniel's former research assistant, Dr. Robert Rothman, succeeds him in SG-1; but Jack is sure he'll be back. Sha're (or Amaunet's posthumous manual spell?) keeps appearing to Daniel life-like, telling him to forgive Teal'c and together find their boy who, as Harsisis, has all the Goa'uld knowledge in his genetic memory, which, to the Goa'uld, means he must be killed.

Prisoners are sent there to suffer eternal torture. Only Jolinar has ever escaped from Netu. SG-1 mounts a rescue operation with Martouf, top-priority being any information Selmak can offer about Sokar's plan to subjugate the other System Lords, an unprecedented threat for the galaxy. Teal'c must pilot a Goa'uld ship and keep it in orbit as landing is impossible except by small pod. Martouf first taps into Jolinar's memories, which is partially blocked by some trauma beyond physical torture. Only when they're down and in the custody of Netu's lord Bynarr does Sam realize he is the key, in a 'personal' way, but not voluntarily, as she had thought. Sokar learns of their presence from Bynarr and orders the team and craft destroyed, but this also means there must be a way out. Bynarr's First Prime, Nao'nak, has, and is himself, a major surprise.",

Martouf's love for Jolinar makes him betray that the Tok'ra are on planet Entac - a convincing lie, so Apophis's plan to earn Sokar's gratitude, and then kill him when rewarded with the lordship of Netu, is on a shaky basis.

They send a probe through and find two archaeologists. However, when they travel through the Stargate, they find that it is located in a society in civil war: one continent believes that the people were created by a Goa'uld, whilst their enemy believes that humans arrived from another planet - by the Stargate. O'Neill, Carter and Jackson are captured by the authorities and questioned, but Teal'c is wounded and blinded. Can he help SG-1 escape the hostiles and get back through the Stargate?",

He is betrayed as a sacrilegious shol'va (traitor) by Rak'nor, son of a Jaffa friend of his father, and handed to Terok, the torturer of system lord Heru'ur. Ignorant of his fate, the other SG-1 members join Jacob in a risky attempt to take hold of a space mine using a Tok'ra ship piloted by Jacob. En route to Apophis' spaceship, the expedition finds out that Teal'c is being offered as a confidence-building present from Heru'ur to cement an alliance with Apophis against the other system lords, which would make the Goa'uld threat more dangerous than ever. They decide to save Teal'c, but their attempt fails. However, Teal'c's resistance to torture and clear conviction that Goa'uld are not gods finally convinces Rak'nor, who now bravely acts.",

Sam is now a civilian scientist, married to ambassador Joe Faxon, whose only worry is failing to get pregnant. When she double-checks the Aschen doctor Mollem's computer with Dr. Fraiser, who felt superfluous given superior medicine, they discover human fertility is down 90% worldwide in three years. Sam, Daniel and Teal'c turn to retired General Jack, who always warned against handing over technological control, for a daring plan to turn the clock back like General Hammond did once, sending a message to their past with the exact time of a solar flare, which Sam can calculate using the Aschen computer. Only one ingredient is out of their reach: the GDO device to control the Stargate's iris, which is in the White House. Sam implores her husband Joe to steal it, but he has a secret as well as sincere objections.",

Soon after, Daniel develops violent mood swings and is committed to a hospital with a neurotransmitter brain condition, presumed fatal after all the other SG-5 members die. Meanwhile, SG-3 has visited the planet, finding only the light installation Daniel reported as particularly fascinating and a human teenage boy, Loran, who hid from Daniel's expedition, but now tells Jack he was left there by his parents, scientific researchers. Back in SGC, Jack also develops symptoms. Sam and Dr. Fraiser conclude that it must be some addiction linked to the light, so when Daniel is nearly terminal Jack, who might not have been exposed too long himself, must bring him back. Jack insists they try turning off the light, and leans on Loran, who is looking for a father-figure; he even gives Teal'c an early 'birthday present,' but has a dark secret.",

She gives him a clear choice - he can choose to die or to ascend but if it's the latter, he will not be able to help his friends fight Anubis, who has yet to be disposed of. He strikes up a conversation with another patron, Jim, who has his own take on the situation. Meanwhile, Sam decides the time has come for her fiancé to meet her father, Jacob. Jacob is not well, however, something he has kept from Sam for several weeks. After Pete surprises her - he thinks he's found the perfect house for them - Sam realizes she has to come to grips with her feelings for someone else. Teal'c and Master Bra'tac have information that Anubis may be gathering what remains of his forces for an attack on Dakara.",

After the funeral, Catherine's niece gives Daniel \"a few odds and ends\" that her aunt wanted him to have. Upon delivery it is discovered that almost her entire collection was shipped to Daniel's lab. He finds in one of her books a possible location of a ZPM, but scans of the area showed that it was no longer there. Daniel proposes that they use the Ancient's time machine to take it from Ra at Giza in 3000 BC.",

The confusion is quickly resolved when the \"real\" SG-1 returns at the correct time. Dr. Lam examines them all and concludes that they are identical and thinks they might be clones. Sam, however, thinks they may have come from a parallel universe as the result of the black hole they created when they destroyed the Ori beachhead. As more SG-1 teams arrive from other alternate universes, one of them includes Dr. Fraiser and another includes the Tok'ra Martouf. It's left to Sam and Martouf to find a way to send them all home.",

                "description": "The SG-1 team hadn't counted on a real dragon as a guardian until one flies out, breathing fire. However, Daniel thinks the Sangraal probably is a hologram. They escape, but the dragon follows them outside. Ba'al admits not to know its secret name, while Daniel believes that the name probably holds power over it. While they guess, Cam thinks of luring the dragon to blow it up, but the C4 barely impresses its digestion. Daniel makes it disappear by using Morgan le Fay's name in Ancient, Ganos Lal. They find it had guarded the frozen 'grave' of the realm's arch-magician, Merlin (or rather, Myrrdin). Vala accidentally triggers a mechanism which revives Merlin when she approaches an Ancient repository device. In the meantime, the team is transported to another planet via the obelisk by the gate outside. Sam surmises that the gate and obelisk are programmed to dial automatically every few hours and transport them to a set of planets that are cut off from the rest of the gate system. Unfortunately, they can't dial out to any other planets either while the program is operating. When he comes to, Merlin seems to confuse the team and Ba'al, with Arthurian characters, but once convinced they are on the same side, he goes to work with the Ancient device to create the Sangraal. Merlin dies at the device, wishing them good luck and referring to one last task. Ba'al's stargate programming skills now seem their only chance. Daniel tries the Ancient repository device himself, but is knocked unconscious. Meanwhile, Adria keeps searching for them via the stargate dialing program on different planets- each time a bit quicker- being one planet behind them. While she is searching, the team is once again transported to another planet, minus Merlin's body. Daniel awakens with valuable memories from Merlin and tries to construct the Sangraal using the repository device again, in exhaustingly intense phases, and finds it also gives him telekinetic powers. It also messes with Daniel's mind, having two different personalities and memories present (his own and Merlin's). Before he can finish the work, Sam and Ba'al disengage the dialing device, just as Adria's Ori troops arrive, allowing SG-1 to escape. Adria is able to capture Daniel before he can escape as well.",

Her husband, Tomin, captures her but claims to not love her. He is ordered, as punishment for being deceived by her, to re-educate her. Sam and Cam are able to activate the functioning part of the device, so their building is cloaked from the Ori, who threaten the village leaders and discover and arrest Teal'c. Even after the remaining villagers bow in submission, the Prior decides to destroy everyone since he couldn't find Sam, which makes Tomin doubt his faith, inform Vala, and confront the Prior. The villagers want to sacrifice Teal'c, but one leader stops them.

Hoping there is still some of his personality left, the team (plus General Jack O'Neill) kidnaps him. Daniel explains how he temporarily has Merlin's personality and knowledge in himself, and had deliberately allowed Adria to turn him into a Prior, while delaying to finish Merlin's weapon she'd wanted, and hoping to get an Ori ship for Earth's side. But time is running out since the team took unexpectedly long to rescue him. Still, the generals, Carter, and Vala are most reluctant to go along with releasing him and opening the wormhole he needs to bring the weapon through. Even the White House wants to kill Daniel, or at best, keep him in stasis until he is reverted to his human nature by Merlin's genetic manipulation. But then his plan is wasted - unless the others can be trained to do it in his place (so only they are at risk, not the entire galaxy in case Daniel is Adria's Trojan Horse). After giving them the necessary information, Daniel suddenly frees himself while Richard Woolsey is with him and takes control of a space ship after beaming up Jack too, just after the others have undertaken their mission to Adria's lair, where Daniel, about to be genetically reverted, arrives just in time to tip the balance in their favor.",

General Landry asks Dr. Lam to help him resume contact with her mother, Kim, his ex-wife. Even after the cargoes are found and blown up, Vala abhors her dad's entry. The general asks her to go easy on him, realizing that he, too, neglected his daughter because of his career, even if Jacek's neglect was just criminal. When Cam and Daniel go tell Jacek he shouldn't scam people, he tricks them into talking to Vala for him. Vala goes over just for catharsis, telling him she's through picking up the pieces of his tricks, and he certainly keeps scamming - as Daniel also finds - even with Terak, a Jaffa from an escaped cargo ship, who hopes to sell the Naquadah. When they are apprehended, Jacek promises to help track it and override the rigging of the cargo ship. The Jaffa wait for Jacek and Vala, intending to eliminate them now that Terak is gone, but SG-1 saves them. Since there never was an override, Jacek cheerfully flies away alone in the cargo ship, ignoring that his treachery was anticipated: it's a decoy.",

Vala tells her scary daughter how she helped Daniel, after a dream, reading the mysterious clava thessara-symbol's mystery, which led to a single planet address, where Athena's treasure house must be; after a disastrous visit there, the team refused to follow the next interpretation, fearing it's just a trap set up by Adria, so Vala is declared a security risk, grounded and confined to Area 51, but escapes through the Stargate. Adria takes her along as she hears the team still plans to visit the address, by starship. Upon arrival, they are trapped by SG-1, which, however, finds itself surrounded by lord Ba'al's troops. Ba'al uses the rings to beam up Adria into an electromagnetic cage in his starship. Back on Earth, General Landry worries what damage the two might do together and wants Adria back. Daniel and Sam now show Vala she has been implanted by Galaran technology with fake recollections of her entire adventure 'til the meeting with Adria. Even though she claims that's impossible, Ba'al is confident he can take control over Adria's loyal Ori troops through her- by implanting a symbiote. The team finds Ba'al's Jaffa and clones killed by symbiote poison, except one Jaffa who secretly used tretonin. The team ring-beams from the cloaked Odyssey starship into Ba'al's, shoots him and captures Adria, but back on Earth, she is found to be under the control of his symbiote. Instead of just killing the evil double, they contact the Tok'ra which send Ta'Seem to extract the symbiote and replace it with a Tok'ra one, but Ba'al manages to poison Adria, who has to be put down. Suddenly Adria wakes up, uses mind-power barricading herself in the sick bay with Vala, tells them she needs time to prepare for ascension, as Daniel guesses outside, and succeeds before the team can cut their way in by blow torch. Nobody knows what this will mean for the future, especially as it remains uncertain whether the Ori are still alive. If not, she may have gained all their former powers, and at least one clone of Ba'al still remains.",

He takes a somewhat different tack however when he sees all of the very friendly young women in the village. Their leader, Lucius Lavin, seems to be a very affable sort and has the locals eating out of their hands. He claims to be an apothecary of sorts and have a cure for every disease, which is certainly of interest to Dr. Beckett. Lavin is invited to Atlantis and soon everyone, including Elizabeth Weir and McKay have fallen victim to his charms. It's left to Sheppard to sort it all out.",

The episode opens up with a pregnant Teyla having been interviewed and reporting back to Atlantis. Ronon is next. Col. Carter is unsure about Ronon's ability to handle the IOA's interview and therefore asks Teal'c to come to Atlantis in a coaching capacity for Ronon. After a rocky start to their relationship, Ronon and Teal'c return to Earth, via the series of Stargates and a Midway Station, that McKay had previously designed. The Midway Station between the Milky Way and Pegasus galaxies serves primarily as a place for those traveling between the galaxies to serve a 24 hour quarantine. While Teal'c and Ronon are serving their quarantine in the extremely cramped Midway Station, it is boarded by the Wraith, via the Stargate, with the intention to travel to Stargate Command on Earth. They achieve this objective, but only with Teal'c and Ronon in tow. What ensues is a battle between the Wraith and the duo of Teal'c and Ronon, for control of Stargate Command.",

Sheppard and the others think they know who might be spreading the virus and why. Teyla meanwhile believes she is receiving messages from Kanaan, the father of her child. She's getting his messages while sleeping and most think she's just dreaming. She follows the clues he gives her but she is taken prisoner by an old enemy who has very specific plans for her.

In flashbacks, the three judge tribunal recounts the indictment against them including the re-awakening of the Wraith and the various missions where at least a few, if not more, innocent bystanders were killed. Sheppard does his best to argue that on balance, fewer were killed by their presence than would have been the case if they had never been there. A least one of the judges is clearly determined to find them guilty while a second seems far more sympathetic. It's left to Richard Woolsey, who has now joined them, to plead the rest of their case. A lawyer by profession, Richard clearly knows how the game is played and focuses on that third judge.",

While Sheppard and McKay try to get their hands on a jumper to launch an attack, Ronon and others who were taken prisoner by Michael during his initial invasion launch reprisals of their own. When Teyla manages to get away and hide, Michael gives her a simple choice: surrender herself and her child to him or he will use the city's self-destruct mechanism to kill everyone.",

The base was created on a distant planet to take advantage of a powerful energy supply located there. Their goal is to try to determine the purpose of the mysterious ninth symbol of the Stargate, which they've never been able to lock in. In going through the Stargate, they are transported not to Earth, but to a very old apparently uninhabited spacecraft. With the group's commander injured, Lt. Scott and the chief scientist - Dr. Nicholas Rush - lead the exploration of the craft. Several areas of the ship have been damaged but it is basically functional. They are able to learn that they are, in fact, billions of light years from Earth. Part 2: Tensions rise as the new arrivals explore the ship. Dr. Rush comes under suspicion with his secretive behavior and attitude. He determines however that the ship is losing air. They find a damaged room that is partly exposed to space but the problem is that the door can only be closed from the inside. Who is prepared to sacrifice their life for the others? Once that problem is solved, Rush determines that the level of carbon dioxide is rising rapidly. The ship comes out of hyperspace near a planet that will have the materials needed to fix the scrubbers. They are given only 12 hours to get what they need.",

When Destiny drops out of FTL the only planet in range is an ice planet with a toxic atmosphere and only two of the space suits are operational. Colonel Young and Lieutenant Scott gate to the planet and start the search for pure ice using Eli's new invention, a hover cart. When the Colonel is away, Johansen, who is currently in charge, discovers that the dust aliens Scott found on another planet followed him to Destiny and are using up massive amounts of water. The aliens seem harmless until aggravated by a startled crew member and attack him. Meanwhile, Scott and Young have found pure ice a ways from the gate and have returned for a second load. Johansen has a plan to trap the aliens in an air locked room, but when they do the now angered aliens begin to look for a way out. Back on the planet, while returning to the stargate with another load of ice, Lt. Scott fall into a crevasse during a tremor and becomes stuck. With Young attempting to dislodge him and pull him out, another tremor causes the crevasse to enclose tighter and rupture Scott's suit, causing him to slowly lose consciousness. With time running out, Young must decide whether or not to leave Scott behind and get the ice back to Destiny. On Destiny, the trapped aliens find a way out of the locked room, so Johansen comes up with a plan to lure them into a container of water and lock them in. Another tremor occurs on the planet and releases Scott to fall farther into the crevasse but Young is able to catch him just in time and pull him out, just in time to rush to the gate to see the container of aliens being hurdled out through the stargate and gate back before Destiny goes back into FTL. The ice provide some water but the problem remains: there is not enough water to survive.",

TJ has tried everything known to her but she cannot get the fungus to stop spreading. Col. Young refuses them permission to return to Destiny to prevent the spread of the unknown disease and they face the prospect of having to surgically remove Scott's arm. In his unconscious state, Scott imagines himself returning home to Cloverdale where he is to be married to Chloe. In his dream-like state, roles and identities have changed: Sgt. Greer is his best friend and is with him to act as his best man; Eli is Chloe's brother; Col. Young his father; TJ is a paramedic who treats him after he loses consciousness; and Dr. Rush is the Minister who will marry them.",

He's drinking heavily and begins to have a recurring dream where Destiny is attacked by the aliens they had earlier encountered. They are demanding Chloe's return and in the first few dreams, his refusal to do so leads to Destiny's destruction. In a later dream, he eventually relents and hands Chloe over to them, leading to a major confrontation with Lt. Scott. He is convinced that his dreams are a premonition but Dr. Rush has a different interpretation. As well, Rush still hasn't told anyone that he now has complete control of the ship.

                "description": "Eli and Rush have found a way to identify the location of drone mother ships using Destiny's long range sensors. The bad news is that the drones seems to be awaiting them at every possible stop along Destiny's path. They find a temporary solution to neutralize the mother ships but realize that they cannot engage in a major battle every time they need to re-supply. Eli suggest that they use the stasis pods for the crew and jump to the next galaxy, a trip that will take three years. All goes well until they realize that one of the pods has been damaged and one person will have to stay behind in the hopes of fixing the unit in the short time available or die.",
